## **Learning Plan for Bioinformatics**
This semester, my goal is to gain a strong foundation in the principles and skills of bioinformatics. To achieve this goal, I plan to:

- In the 1-2 weeks, master basic programming skills and data analysis skills. I have some programming skills before, but R is new thing for me.
- 3-16 weeks, learn how to analyze various biological data practically, especially the application of machine learning.
- For our courses, attend all lectures and actively participate in class discussions, take notes carefully. Complete all assignments and labs on time, and seek help from the instructor or TA if needed.
- Attend additional bioinformatics seminars or workshops outside of class to broaden my knowledge and skills. If possible, I hope to intern in some relevant labs to gain a deeper and more cutting-edge understanding.




## **NOTES**

### **Lec1**

#### **Algorithm vs. Model**

1. An algorithm is a **step-by-step** procedure for solving a problem, while a model is a **simplified representation** of a complex system. 
2. Algorithms are used to process and **analyze data**, while models are used to **make predictions** or **test hypotheses** about biological systems.

- For example, a popular algorithm used in bioinformatics is the *Smith-Waterman algorithm*, which is used for sequence alignment. This algorithm takes two DNA or protein sequences as input and outputs a score that represents the degree of similarity between the two sequences.

- On the other hand, a popular model used in bioinformatics is the *Hidden Markov Model*, which is used for predicting protein structure and function. This model represents a protein as a series of states, with transitions between the states representing the movement of the protein through time. By analyzing the probabilities of different state transitions, the model can predict the overall structure and function of the protein.

#### **2 types of problems**

Data Problems:
- Representation (graphics) 
- Storage and retrieval (databases) 
- Analysis method (statistics, artificial intelligence, optimization, etc.)

Biology Problems: 
- Interpreting biological sequences
- Predicting structure or function
- Mining clinical (i.e. cancer) data/information
